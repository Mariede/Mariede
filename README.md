### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michel, I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, a city located in southeast of Brazil where I lived most of my life. I'm working with IT for about 20 years, since I finished my university. By the way, I am a qualified Computer Engineer here.

About 11 years ago I moved to a city near SÃ£o Paulo called Sorocaba and for 9 years I worked as a public servant, in the position of Systems Analyst as a permanent employee for their city hall. Sorocaba has nearly 700k inhabitants. Nowadays I'm working mostly as a freelancer a taking some time for other important things.

I like music, running and pc games (especially rpgs and mmos)â€¦ I enjoy some contact sports too, like Muay Thai - it is awesome for the fitness. It is also great when I can spend some time watching any good series on TV.

Since finally I got my "cittadinanza", right now I am studying Italian language too. Side note: when possible, I really enjoy to study JavaScript and JavaScript related things! (except Typescript! =DD I "can" live with, but don't see a good point in using that. It's messy)

### Objectives

I am dedicated, detailed and focused. For me, ideally, coding is like painting and I must have the time to fully finish it and appreciate the results. Things have been changing a lot all these years but I'm still engaged! Thank's to so many awesome coders out there. =)

if you have any question or want to contact me, feel free to find me by e-mail ok. Best regards, peace brothers.

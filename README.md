### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michel, I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, a city located in southeast of Brazil where I lived most of my life. I'm working with IT for about 20 years, since I finished my university. By the way, I am a qualified Computer Engineer here.

About 11 years ago I moved to a city near SÃ£o Paulo called Sorocaba and for the last 9 years until now I am a public servant, working in the position of Systems Analyst as a permanent employee for their city hall. Nowadays Sorocaba has nearly 700k inhabitants.

I like music, cycling, running and pc games (but sadly I am not having enough time to play with)â€¦ running is something that a discovered to enjoy not too long ago. It is also great when I can spend some time watching any good series on Netflix or Disney+. Right now I am studying Italian language. Side note: when possible, I really enjoy to study JavaScript related things! (except Typescript! =DD I can live with, but don't see a good point in using that. It's messy)

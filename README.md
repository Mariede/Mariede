### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michel, I live in Brazil. I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, a city located in southeast of my country where I lived most of my life. I'm working with IT for about 20 years, since I finished my university. By the way, I am a qualified Computer Engineer here.

About 10 years ago I moved to a city near SÃ£o Paulo called Sorocaba, and for the last 8 years until now I am a public servant working as a Systems Analyst for their city hall. Nowadays Sorocaba has nearly 700k inhabitants.

I like music, bike, run and pc gamesâ€¦ some contact sports, bodybuilding sometimes. Running is something that a discovered to enjoy a lot, but not long ago. It is also great when I can spend some time watching any good series on Netflix (Breaking Bad, Better call Saul, Fargo, Black Mirror, La Casa de Papel, Merli, Tonari no Totoro, â€¦).

### Objectives

I am dedicated and focused. Things have been changing a lot and I'm still here! So many awesome coders out there but sometimes I still get proud of myself too. =) Since a while I have decided to Looking for evolving in a new culture, always balancing work and life quality. It would be great to find some nice new foreign friends too.

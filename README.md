### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michel, I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, a city located in southeast of Brazil where I lived most of my life. I'm working with IT for about 20 years, since I finished my university. By the way, I am a qualified Computer Engineer here.

About 10 years ago I moved to a city near SÃ£o Paulo called Sorocaba, and for the last 8 years until now I am a public servant working as a Systems Analyst for their city hall. Nowadays Sorocaba has nearly 700k inhabitants.

I like music, cycling, running and pc gamesâ€¦ running is something that a discovered to enjoy a lot not too long ago. It is also great when I can spend some time watching any good series on Netflix (Breaking Bad, Better call Saul, Fargo, Black Mirror, documentariesâ€¦). Another strange thing that I really enjoy is to study JavaScript related things!

### Objectives

I am dedicated and focused. Things have been changing a lot and I'm still here! So many awesome coders out there but sometimes I still get proud of myself too. =)

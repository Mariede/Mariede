### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---

My name is Michel, I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, a city located in southeast of Brazil where I lived most of my life. I've worked with IT for about 20 years, since I finished my university. By the way, I am a qualified Computer Engineer here. I have dual citizenship, brazilian and italian.

About more than a decade ago I moved to a city near SÃ£o Paulo called Sorocaba and for many years I worked as a public servant, in the position of Systems Analyst as a permanent employee for their city hall. Sorocaba has nearly 700k inhabitants. Nowadays I've changed my life focus to a more spiritual approach, doing other things for live. I had a good time programming, but now it looks is mostly done from doing that.

I like music, running and pc games especially metroidvanias, soulks like, rpgs, arpgs - mmos rest in peace, we had good times tooâ€¦ I enjoy some contact sports too, like Muay Thai.
